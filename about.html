        <p1 class="paragraphClass">The effects of ocean pollution are long-lasting and will continue to worsen over the years. Despite not feeling the immediate effects of it at the moment, the future generations will eventually be left to suffer the consequences of our actions. At the rate that we are proceeding, the  Earth and its marine inhabitants that we have come to know and love will dissipate as a result of our continuous pollution of mother nature.We are not advocating for the complete abolishment of ocean pollution over the world for that is evidently impossible. Instead, we aim to raise awareness on the matter and make people more aware of our reality to stifle the effects of our pollution conundrum. </p1>

        <p2 class="paragraphClass">There are two common misconceptions about ocean pollution. The first misconception is that humans are not directly affected by it. Chemicals from items such as pesticides, nutrients from fertilizers, etc. that have found their way into the ocean contaminates our water supplies. Desalination of ocean water to drinking water is common practice all over the world. However, when our water is severely contaminated, the clean-drinking supply becomes limited. Contaminated water causes health effects such as but not limited to gastrointestinal illnesses, nervous system or reproductive effects, and chronic diseases such as cancer Additionally, the marine life that we consume are infected with loads of toxins. These toxins transfer onto us and result in an array of illness. The second misconception on the other hand is that you cannot get actively involved. Actions such as hosting a bottle drive, beach clean up, or even simply segregating your trash at home is enough to limit the pollution occuring in our oceans. A little change to you, results in big effects for the world.</p2>
