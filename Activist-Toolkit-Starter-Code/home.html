      <h2>Understanding the Issue</h2> 
      <br>
      <p1 class="paragraphsHome">The ocean comprises 70% of our planet earth and is home to a vast majority of underwater organisms. The ocean sustains not only its inhabitants, but humans as well. It supplies a vast array of essential commodities such as oxygen, meals, livelihood, and medicine, hence its destruction becomes a cause of concern. </p1>
      <br><br>

      <p2 class="paragraphsHome">The leading cause of ocean pollution is plastics that are mass-produced by large corporations. Although they are inexpensive and possess endless applications,  they take 20-500 years to biodegrade. Additionally, light noise, nutrients from fertilizer runoff, and industrial chemicals further elevate the pollution evident in bodies of water. These factors contribute to the rise in our ocean’s acidity, leading to acidification. As a result of this, the ocean becomes too toxic for certain marine life to survive in. This both affects our country’s economy and results in long-term health conditions.	</p2>
